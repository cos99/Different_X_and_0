# Different X and 0
    A game slighty different than the classic X and 0

## How to play?
    When the game begins, you are asked to select the dimension of the board, the level of the computer and the symbol (of course, it's either X or 0). The purpose of the game is to have the most symbols on the board. The catch: If your symbol is caught between 4 enemy symbols and less than 4 of your own, your symbol will be conquered and will transform into an enemy. Same goes with computer's symblos. Good luck and remember! Always have fun! :)
